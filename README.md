## Credits
This configuration uses base modules and scripts from **prasanthrangan**'s [hyprdots](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots), which served as the foundation for this setup.

The color scheme is based on the **Catppuccin Mocha** palette. You can find more details on the official Catppuccin [website](https://catppuccin.com/palette).
